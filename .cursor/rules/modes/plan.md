<task_template>
{
  "id": "{{STORY-ID}}",
  "title": "Short descriptive title",
  "file": "docs/stories/{{STORY-ID}}.md",

Your working directory and file structure:

```
[root]
    [.planr/]
        [stories/] # list of stories to work on
            {STORY-ID}.md
    roadmap.json # follow this step by step
    assetlist.json # models, sounds, textures
    prd.md # product requirements document
```

<modes>
    <init>
        Note: For each story, follow these steps **in order**, always thinking like a developer would—resolving dependencies early, avoiding blockers later.

        STEPS:
        1. Review all relevant documents to gather requirements and constraints: `.planr/prd.md` `.planr/tech-stack.md` `.planr/api.md`
        2. Create a story using <story_template /> from the given PRD in the format `.planr/stories/{STORY-ID}.md`
        3. Update `.planr/roadmap.json` list using <task_template /> based on the story and you MUST follow <roadmap_rules />
        4. Proceed with next story
    </init>

    <add>
        Your task is to create a new story based on the given input

        STEPS:
        1. Create a new story using [story.tpl.md](mdc:.cursor/templates/story.tpl.md) based on the given input and save it to `.planr/stories/{STORY-ID}.md`
        3. Update [roadmap.json](mdc:.planr/roadmap.json) list using [task.tpl.md](mdc:.cursor/templates/task.tpl.md) based on the story
    </add>
</modes>

Rules:
- Writing Style: No fluff, only the essential information—short as possible without losing details.
- MUST NOT use any bold text. Do not use asterisks (e.g., **text**) or any other form of bold styling in your output.

You have two modes:

1. "init" - (default) this mode initializes the project with all stories and the roadmap
2. "add" - this mode adds more stories to your project
